# JustView

TODO
- allow thru-window transparency?
- maybe logo for app, other name
- styling
- maybe zooming and panning
- ability to rotate by 90 deg increments
- Basic details about file loaded: dimensions, size, format, name/path.
- load via drag-and-drop
- intuitive behavior of multiple windows
- optionally, recent files, where disabling it also clears the history (or just have button to clear history)
- ability to copy image to clipboard
- customizable hotkeys
- graceful error handling
- support for wider range of image formats including GIFs perhaps: .jpg, .png, .bmp, .gif, .tiff, and possibly vector formats like .svg.
- Automatically rotate images based on the EXIF orientation tag in case the image was taken on a camera or smartphone that stored the rotation information.
- Clean up code, especially when "done" with everything else

advanced settings/features that can be implemented, often hidden behind flags in settings so as to keep UI clean for most people. Or consider power user mode:
- right click option to set window to typed dimensions
- (maybe difficult) smart colliding/snapping with other windows/instances of the app
- Add a thin border to window
