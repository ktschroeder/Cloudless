# JustView

TODO 
- Good one: setting for image-associated opening: Option to auto set dimension to "true" dimensions of the image. But, max height and width of screen space. Also, option to do the same but at max would be like 90% of screen height/width, maybe user-coonfigured values.
-
- fix F11
- allow thru-window transparency?
- maybe logo for app, other name
- styling
- maybe zooming and panning
- hotkeys: O or CTRL O for opening image
- ability to rotate by 90 deg increments
- allow escape of fullscrreen with ESC
- Basic details about file loaded: dimensions, size, format, name/path.
- load via drag-and-drop
- intuitive behavior of multiple windows
- optionally, recent files, where disabling it also clears the history (or just have button to clear history)
- ability to copy image to clipboard
- customizable hotkeys
- graceful error handling
- support for wider range of image formats including GIFs perhaps: .jpg, .png, .bmp, .gif, .tiff, and possibly vector formats like .svg.
- Automatically rotate images based on the EXIF orientation tag in case the image was taken on a camera or smartphone that stored the rotation information.

advanced settings/features that can be implemented, often hidden behind flags in settings so as to keep UI clean for most people. Or consider power user mode:
- whether to open files at a default dimensions, or "true dimensions"
- right click option to set window to typed dimensions
- (maybe difficult) smart colliding/snapping with other windows/instances of the app
- hotkey to close window
- Add a thin border to window
