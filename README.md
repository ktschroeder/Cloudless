# Cloudless
Cloudless is a lightweight, minimal-UI image viewer for Windows, built on Windows Presentation Foundation. It's feature-rich, but visually quiet and minimal.

- Load images from inside the app, or directly via filetype association. Navigate through images in the current directory. View and open recent images.
- Smoothly zoom and pan in images.
- Copy image files and/or contents directly, or copy a compressed version that fits a configured max size (Goodbye, Discord upload rejections!)
- Enjoy a variety of configurations related to viewing style, border, transparency, and more.
- Play and control GIFs (pause, restart, loop).
- Utilize various hotkeys to quickly change preferences such as zoom, window dimensions, whether always-on-top, and many more.
- A bunch of other stuff.
- Zen.
