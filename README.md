# JustView

TODO 
- fix F11
- allow thru-window transparency?
- maybe logo for app, other name
- styling

advanced settings/features that can be implemented, often hidden behind flags in settings so as to keep UI clean for most people. Or consider power user mode:
- whether to open files at a default dimensions, or "true dimensions"
- right click option to set window to typed dimensions
- (maybe difficult) smart colliding/snapping with other windows/instances of the app
- hotkey to close window
- Add a thin border to window
